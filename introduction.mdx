Welcome, developers! Our docs cover guides, examples, references, and more to help you build extensions and share them with [our community](https://raycast.com/community) and [your team](/teams/getting-started).

The Raycast Platform consists of two parts:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="API" icon="rectangle-terminal" iconType="duotone">
    This allows developers to build rich extensions with React, Node.js, and
    TypeScript. The docs explain how to use the API to build top-notch
    experiences.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Store" icon="store" iconType="duotone">
    This lets developers share their extensions with all Raycast users. You'll
    learn how to [publish your extension](/basics/publish-an-extension).
