The Environment APIs are useful to get context about the setup in which your command runs. You can get information about the extension and command itself as well as Raycast. Furthermore, a few paths are injected and are helpful to construct file paths that are related to the command's assets.

## API Reference

### environment

Contains environment values such as the Raycast version, extension info, and paths.

#### Example

```
import { environment } from "@raycast/api";

export default async function Command() {
  console.log(`Raycast version: ${environment.raycastVersion}`);
  console.log(`Extension name: ${environment.extensionName}`);
  console.log(`Command name: ${environment.commandName}`);
  console.log(`Command mode: ${environment.commandMode}`);
  console.log(`Assets path: ${environment.assetsPath}`);
  console.log(`Support path: ${environment.supportPath}`);
  console.log(`Is development mode: ${environment.isDevelopment}`);
  console.log(`Appearance: ${environment.appearance}`);
  console.log(`Text size: ${environment.textSize}`);
  console.log(`LaunchType: ${environment.launchType}`);
}
```

## environment.canAccess

Checks whether the user can access a specific API or not.

#### Signature

```
function canAccess(api: any): bool;
```

#### Example

```
import { unstable_AI, showHUD, environment } from "@raycast/api";
import fs from "fs";

export default async function main() {
  if (environment.canAccess(AI)) {
    const answer = await unstable_AI.ask("Suggest 5 jazz songs");
    await Clipboard.copy(answer);
  } else {
    await showHUD("You don't have access :(");
  }
}
```

#### Return

A Boolean indicating whether the user running the command has access to the API.

### getSelectedFinderItems

Gets the selected items from Finder.

#### Signature

```
async function getSelectedFinderItems(): Promise<filesystemitem[]>;</filesystemitem[]>
```

#### Example

```
import { getSelectedFinderItems, showToast, Toast } from "@raycast/api";

      title: "Cannot copy file path",
      message: String(error),
    });
  }
}
```

#### Return

A Promise that resolves with the [selected file system items](/api-reference/environment#filesystemitem). If Finder is not the frontmost application, the promise will be rejected.

### getSelectedText

Gets the selected text of the frontmost application.

#### Signature

```
async function getSelectedText(): Promise;
```

#### Example

```
import { getSelectedText, Clipboard, showToast, Toast } from "@raycast/api";

export default async function Command() {
  try {

    await Clipboard.paste(transformedText);
  } catch (error) {
    await showToast({
      style: Toast.Style.Failure,
      title: "Cannot transform text",
      message: String(error),
    });
  }
}
```

#### Return

A Promise that resolves with the selected text. If no text is selected in the frontmost application, the promise will be rejected.
