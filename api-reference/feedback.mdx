Raycast has several ways to provide feedback to the user:

- [Toast](/api-reference/feedback/toast) _\- when an asynchronous operation is happening or when an error is thrown_

- [HUD](/api-reference/feedback/hud) _\- to confirm an action worked after closing Raycast_

- [Alert](/api-reference/feedback/alert) _\- to ask for confirmation before taking an action_
