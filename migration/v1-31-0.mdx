title: "v1.31.0"

This version introduces support for multiple `<List.Item>` accessories via a new [accessories prop](/api-reference/user-interface/list#list.item.accessory).

The `accessoryTitle` and `accessoryIcon` props still work, but are now marked as deprecated and may be removed in a future version. You will get helpful hints in your code editor to migrate your extension, and as usual we provide automated [migrations](/migration) to help with the transition.

To migrate your extension manually, you need to ensure that all `List.Items` that specify `accessoryTitle` and/or `accessoryIcon` are updated as follows:

## `List.Item` with `accessoryTitle`

```

// becomes

```

## `List.Item` with `accessoryIcon`

```

// becomes

```

## `List.Item` with `accessoryTitle` and `accessoryIcon`

```

// becomes

```
